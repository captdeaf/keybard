  <h3>Serial Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    Did you know: You don't have to click each key one by one to assign to
    them. Select a serial assignment method under MENU-&gt; Serial Assignment,
    and select a key. When it's bound to a new key, the active key to select
    jumps to the next in its series.
