  <h3>Quick actions for keys</h3>
  <p>
    Did you know: R-Clicking a key in your keyboard map will show you some easy
    shortcuts! If this doesn't work, be aware that the most common cause is a
    browser extension intended to prevent websites from hijacking context menus
  </p>
  <p>
    You can assign and edit an unused macro or tapdance instantly, enter a
    key code by its raw QMK value, clear or disable it, or revert the change
    before committing it!
  </p>
  <p>
    This also works for most keys you can bind in combos, key overrides, macros,
    and tap dance!
