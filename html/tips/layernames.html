<div class="tip">
  <h3>Layer names</h3>
  <p>
    Did you know: You can assign cosmetic names to your layers in Keybard!
    These are in-memory, and saved in your .kbi file on download, so other apps
    such as vial will not recognize or show layer names.
  </p>
  <p>
    To rename a layer, r-click its number in the layer selection tab, and
    enter its name! To clear, just submit an empty string at the prompt.
