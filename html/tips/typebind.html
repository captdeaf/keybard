<div class="tip">
  <h3>TypeBind</h3>
  <p>
    Did you know: While normally you click a key in your keyboard, then a key
    in the example boards to bind it to - you can use your keyboard to bind
    it to a key! Enable "Typing binds a key" in the menu, then click a key
    to assign to, then just type the key on your keyboard!
  </p>
  <p>
    Bonus: works exceptionally well with Serial Assignment!
